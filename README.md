# Research Assignment: Parallel LU Decomposition for the GPU
This repository tracks the writing of my research assignment for the 1st and 2nd year of the master studies course _Applications of Software Engineering_ at the Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering - Czech Technical University in Prague.

As the the development of the decomposition project itself will continue as part of my master's thesis, it is located in a private GitLab repository.

Abstract:

> The main focus of this project revolves around the parallelization of the LU decomposition
method on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Specifically, the study of the architecture and software
layer of Nvidia GPUs in order to deliver an effective decomposition solution and compare it to the CPU
implementation. To facilitate this, a project containing unit tests and a benchmarking framework was
implemented. The benchmarks were run on a set of curated matrices with varying characteristics on a
state-of-the-art compute cluster. The results of the benchmarks were analyzed and an implementation
was recommended for general use
